As member of the SCM team for Rational Team Concert. I do work on tooling development for source code management. This includes different tasks such as migrations from Windows servers to Linux boxes, Dockerization of tools such as centralization login with ELK or github webhooks processing, automation of tools installation and update using python scripts, database and web server maintenance and configuration, security configuration and many more.

I do also support a wide number of developer teams, troubleshooting daily issues, mostly related with CI/CD, team organization and process automation.
